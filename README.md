# Fantasy football using ESPN

## Project Info
This is my personal fantasy football league. Additional information and help can be found on my medium article [here](https://medium.com/@andrew.picart/data-cleaning-and-eda-with-espn-fantasy-football-1b13346ebdca)

## Getting Started
1. Download and install ff-espn-api from the resources below.
2. You will need to provide your own **keys.py** file. They must include the following: **leauge_id**, **swid**, **espn_s2**. The [ff-espn-api wiki](https://github.com/cwendt94/ff-espn-api/wiki) has the steps for finding these variables from your league.
3. Import **leaguealize.py**. You can then create you league using the **create_league()** method, with the year of the season you wish to import.
